Background
* Provide a link to the “original” StoryTime game that we are basing our app on. (Sociables/Kings Cup? Or check out the improv game “one-word-at-a-time”, it’s pretty much the same idea). 
* Mention any games that we found that involve a group of people “contributing”.
* Reference papers that discuss research with collaborative games. 
* Reference papers to CSCW in general.
* Refine our research question? (She said it felt a bit too specific). 
* Clearly define who our sample population is for data collection.
* For the phases of research: 
* Give an overview of each phase
* Justify each phase
* Discuss limitations/benefits of the approach
* Give details of each phase 
* Clearly explain the work that we’ve done so far (prototypes, user study, etc.) 
* Don’t mix up survey and interview (they are two different things)! 
* Explain the purpose of doing a second interview.
* Think about whether we need to worry about security.
* Mention how many people we envision playing our game.
* Ensure that our milestones match the descriptions of the work that we’ve been doing.
* Go into more detail for our milestones (it was too high level).


Introduction
Need to mention distributed cognition. Peggy mentioned how this is important for this project and it relates to CSCW.
"Developed by Edwin Hutchins, distributed cognition is the theory that knowledge lies not only within the individual but in the individual's social and physical environment."
The dependence of the theory on the social and physical environment of the individual makes it very useful in analyzing human-computer interactions and educational technologies.

Deliverables - Minimal Viable Product
	Since StoryTime is a project that is focused more on implementation rather than research, our team will be creating a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) in order to conduct further user testing. The MVP will take into consideration the information we gathered and analyzed from our first user testing on the prototypes discussed above. In order to assist in building the MVP, we have created a conceptual design and will use this to conduct a cognitive walkthroughs with each member in our team. This will allow us to easily realize any missing components in our game prior to the MVP implementation.

	The MVP will be implemented as a web application, which when finalized, we intend to release as a Facebook game application. The purpose of the MVP is to decide on the features we have discussed for StoryTime and to determine whether they will be implemented into the final product. The MVP will be designed in a way that allow players to be distributed on their own computers while playing the game. This will allow for a more realistic approach in the user testing, in comparison to the first prototype, which forced the players to pass around a single computer. It is important to note, however, that the implementation of our final product is not in the scope of this project. We will instead discuss what we found from our user testing of the MVP and provide thorough documentation on what we believe the final product will consist of and why.

Technical Specifications
	The conceptual design will be built using...(Sarah fill this?)

 	Although we stated above that the MVP will be implemented after the conceptual design, our team has built the necessary platform in order to start the implementation process. The following are the tools we are using that allow us to collaborate on coding this application:
<li>cPanel and phpMyAdmin to support the database that stores players stories and information</li>
<li>GitHub allowing for version control and collaboration</li>
<li>PhpStorm by Jetbrains as our coding environment</li>
